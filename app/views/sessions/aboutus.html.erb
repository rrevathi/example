<h1>About Us</h1>

	Ravelry is a place for knitters, crocheters, designers, spinners, weavers and dyers to keep track of their yarn, tools, project and pattern information, and look to others for ideas and inspiration. The content here is all user- driven; we as a community make the site what it is. 		Ravelry is a great place for you to keep notes about your projects, see what other people are making, find the perfect pattern and connect 		with people who love to play with yarn from all over the world in our forums.


	Frequently Asked Questions


	How did this site come about?

	Jess had been a knitter and a blogger for a while, and, because she was an active blogger, she knew that there was all this great information out there from other fiber lovers â€“ but with the growing number of crochet and knitting blogs, finding that information just kept getting 		harder! It was getting frustrating for her to try and find information about the patterns and yarns that she was interested in using. Casey 		thought that he would be able to build a website that could solve her problems, so they started working on it together, introducing it to a 		few friends at a time.

	Ravelry is a free site now but will membership cost money in the future?


	We have no plans to charge to be a Ravelry member! We want it to be an inclusive community- not just for those who can pay for it. Instead, 		we have tasteful and targeted ads for fibery products and companies that we as a community are actually interested in and want to support!
